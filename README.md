#BCrypt

Implement a user model and auth in your Sinatra project.

##Mobile Nav Menu

Full-width nav items, so that there are large, clickable links at the top of the page. Ideal for mobile devices.
A hamburger icon that reveals the nav section. This means the nav should be hidden (in some way) by default.
Responsive nav, so the full-width nav items become floated left (to form a horizontal nav) or remain vertically stacked but in a sidebar column. This means the hamburger icon should disappear entirely for non-mobile devices, because the navigation is not hidden by default for those device widths.

##Previous Project Description, Truncated: Strava Lite

This application will be a tool for bike commuters or casual, non-spandex-clad recreational riders to track rides and equipment without all of the KOM nonsense that roadies love.

For example: I own three bikes, two of which I use on a regular basis. I don't care about speed or mileage precision, but I would like to track my approximate mileage per week for fitness, as well as how many miles I have ridden on each bike for maintenance purposes.
